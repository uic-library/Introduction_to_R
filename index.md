-------------------------------------------
This workshop helps attendees provides an introduction to R, an overview on installing packages, information on different data types and data structure . Next it dives into a detailed description of functions performed under two main data structures. Finally, logical operators section touches base on basic statistical analysis (eg:univariate analysis). 

The Deafult dataset of cars and colleges will be used to conduct the different analysis. steps on how to import this data are also a part of this workshop.

{% comment %} briefly list workshop goals below - should be the same as the objectives from each workshop section (also repeated in the workshop overview) {% endcomment %}

## Workshop goals
- Understand the R interface
- learn about the data types and data structures
- learn about logical operators 


> ## Pre-requisites
> There are no pre-requisites for this workshop, though basic understanding of working with data and statistics is recommended.
